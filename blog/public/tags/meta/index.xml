&lt;li&gt;being a successful software engineer requires solid communication
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bring others along for the ride; see your vision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work through kinks of ideas; solutions are almost always too large to completely load up cognitively&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code reviews are excellent quality control and educations tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;having a blog is a different way to sharpen the knife - expressing technical concepts
so that they can digestable more broadly. want to find new ways to get better at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ever since my first days of coding, i&amp;rsquo;ve see a huge need to decomplexify complex topics.
in college, it was common for academics to flex as a show of knowledge prowess, and i found
it to be detrimental. i aspire to make various topics approachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a way to get a fresh avenue of perspective and ideas! who knows who will comment on my stuff!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so much in tech is rework. an engineer could literally build the same application / components at every
company they work at. blogs are my way of attempting to share whatever knowledge i have to help
others not re-invent the wheel. let&amp;rsquo;s coordinate people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lastly, it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to consolidate knowledge &amp;amp; learnings. i love learning new things,
but time can be the enemy of retention. taking note of the details empowers me to come
back up to speed on previous topics faster!&lt;/p&gt;
