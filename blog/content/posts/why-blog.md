- being a successful software engineer requires solid communication
  - bring others along for the ride; see your vision
  - work through kinks of ideas; solutions are almost always too large to completely load up cognitively
  - code reviews are excellent quality control and educations tools

having a blog is a different way to sharpen the knife - expressing technical concepts
so that they can digestable more broadly. want to find new ways to get better at this.

ever since my first days of coding, i've see a huge need to decomplexify complex topics.
in college, it was common for academics to flex as a show of knowledge prowess, and i found
it to be detrimental. i aspire to make various topics approachable.

it's a way to get a fresh avenue of perspective and ideas! who knows who will comment on my stuff!

so much in tech is rework. an engineer could literally build the same application / components at every
company they work at. blogs are my way of attempting to share whatever knowledge i have to help
others not re-invent the wheel. let's coordinate people!

lastly, it's a great way to consolidate knowledge & learnings. i love learning new things,
but time can be the enemy of retention. taking note of the details empowers me to come
back up to speed on previous topics faster!
